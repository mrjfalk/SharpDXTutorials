# SharpDXTutorials
Code for my SharpDX Tutorials at www.johanfalk.eu.

## Beginners Tutorial
The beginners tutorial describes the basics of SharpDX, starting with setting up a project in Visual Studio.

### Part 1: Setting up a SharpDX project in Visual Studio 2013
In the first part we create the Visual Studio project, and adding the required NuGet packages. Read the full tutorial [here](BeginnersTutorial-Part1/README.md).

### Part 2: Creating a window
In the second tutorial we create a window which we will later render in. Read tutorial [here](BeginnersTutorial-Part2/README.md).

### Part 3: Initializing DirectX
In this tutorial we initialize DirectX. We set up the swap chain and a backbuffer to render to and finally clear the backbuffer into a nice blue color. Read tutorial [here](BeginnersTutorial-Part3/README.md).

### Part 4: Drawing a triangle
Finally time to draw something else than a blue screen. We draw a simple triangle from three vertices and add a simple vertex and pixel shader. Read tutorial [here](BeginnersTutorial-Part4/README.md).

### Part 5: Coloring the triangle
In this tutorial we will look at setting a specific color for each vertex. The tutorial is available [here](BeginnersTutorial-Part5/README.md).
